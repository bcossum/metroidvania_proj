We are going to create a metroidvania inspired 2D action platfomer

Our goal is to have at least four screens, a spawn, two basic enemy rooms, and a boss room.


The player character will be able to move left, right, jump, and attack and have a health bar
*stretch goal: experience bar allowing level upper
*stretch goal: items (health, weapon upgrade)

rooms will have platforms player can jump to

Enemies will have health
*stretch goal: more than one enemy type

Boss will have health and multiple attacks.

all sprites will have sound cues tied to their events

level will have background music
*stretch goal: boss will have different music
